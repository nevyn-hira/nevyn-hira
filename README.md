# Hi I'm Nevyn.

## In the past:
A fair few years ago I worked on something called the Manaiakalani Project which is a 1:1 laptop learning initiative much like OLPC (One Laptop Per Child). Before Chromebooks were a thing, we were using Asus eee's. We needed a deployment system that didn't rely on infrastructure and a way to customize the "image" for each school as well as add some functionality to make it more suitable for schools. Some of that code is here. I managed to get imaging down to around 3Â½ minutes. Unfortunately it kind of stopped there. I had developed something I was called "Keys to the Castle" that allowed a lot of the admin, such as reimaging a machine if it was really borked or resetting passwords etc., to be done in the classroom by just about anyone with a "stick". I was planning on having a rescue partition type set up that gave that power over to the users. Unfortunately Chromebooks became a thing and I was left purposeless.

The last few years have seen me trying to take on big projects without any stakeholders (difficult to pull something off if no one's willing to communicate their specifications to you).

## Now:
I'm now playing around with some macrokeyboard code (I found a snippet and added a configuration system around it and added a whole lot more functionality to it) and learning go. I am unemployed after I found myself feeling amazingly disillusioned around the rampant racism within the tech industry.

I'm learning Go and considering doing a youtube series on the subject from a "from python" kind of perspective.
 
I don't really care all that much about technologies. Like I don't want to be known as a "go programmer" or whatever. I'm MUCH more interested in empowerment. i.e. what am I making easier and for whom? I will learn the skills I need to pull something off.
